# Projekt Community Overlay

Designed to elevate the streaming experience for Projekt Community, this OBS overlay delivers a sleek, TV-style presentation.

At this moment it includes:

- **Main Header with Logo and Live Ticker**: A prominent header bar displays the Projekt Community logo alongside a dynamic live ticker. The ticker not only shows the current time but can also be customized for countdowns, stream updates, or event schedules. This feature creates a continuous sense of engagement, ensuring viewers stay updated on stream timing.

- **Twitter Feed Integration (#pjkt)**: This live, work-in-progress feature showcases Twitter posts tagged with #pjkt, enabling real-time interaction between viewers and the stream. Tweets appear directly on the overlay, providing an exciting way for the community to contribute live comments, ask questions, or show support. Once enabled, it creates an engaging dialogue between streamers and viewers, fostering a true sense of community.

With its organized layout, customizable features, and broadcast-quality design, this OBS overlay makes stream feel like a professionally produced event, keeping viewers informed, engaged, and part of the action
